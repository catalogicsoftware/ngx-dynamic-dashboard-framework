# Angular-4+-Dashboard-Framework

> Note: This project is under heavy construction and is not intended for general production use yet. As such, we are not accepting bugs at the moment and documentation is quite lacking.

This is an angular 4+ based dashboard framework that is inspired by JIRA's dashboard implementation and https://github.com/angular-dashboard-framework/angular-dashboard-framework

The primary projects leveraged:
* angular 4+ - https://angularjs.org/
* ngx-charts (angular based d3 charts) - https://github.com/swimlane/ngx-charts
* Semantic-UI - https://semantic-ui.com/
* ng2-dnd drag and drop - https://github.com/akserg/ng2-dnd
* angular material

Additional Features:
* Leverages Angular's dynamic data driven forms approach for gadget property pages and properties - https://angular.io/guide/dynamic-form
* Dynamic component strategy for creating gadget instances during runtime - https://angular.io/guide/dynamic-component-loader
